# Daily Planner

## Description 
The daily planner app allows you to add information for each working hour of the day. The current hour is highlighted in red, the timeslot which already 
in the past is grey and future timeslots are highlighted in green colour.
After the Save button is clicked, all changes for the relevant hour will be saved into the localStorage, which will assure that information will stay on the page even after refresh.
